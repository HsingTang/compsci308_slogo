# Before

### Estimation

 * How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
I think it will take me about an hour if I consider the time it will take to get re-acquainted with the codebase.

 * How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
I think I will need to update between 5-7 files. I think this is the case because



# After

### Review

 * How long did it take you to complete this new feature?
It took me just over an hour.

 * How many files did you need to add or update? Why?
I needed to add one file and change about 5 files.

 * Did you get it completely right on the first try? If not, why not?
I didn’t get it right on the first try because I wasn’t making all the necessary changes to the resources folder that was used to load up the view.
### Analysis

 * What do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation --- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
I think it shows that our projects frontend was really well documented and flexible but definitely not simple. There were a lot of moving parts and hoops to jump through.

 * What about the design or documentation could be improved?
I think it would be better to keep some of the frontend resources in the same classes.

 * What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
I think it would have been a bit more confusing because there are a lot of packages and resource files that those packages depend on and I don’t think I would have been able to figure out where everything goes if I wasn’t familiar with the code.
